#try to make an inventory

#try to make a levlling system?
  #great idea, didnt think of leveling in this thing

#how big will the map be?
  #couple of towns
  #a dungeon or 2
  #roads between places with randomised encounters
  #starting area
  #battle zomes
    #maybe each area could be a different script that we import when the player gives an input to go there could be long winded but also makes it so we can spread out the work.

#how do you build a map? 
  #draw a map of the game entire area
  #drawe a map of individual areas ie streets and roads or towns if that big
  3draw a map of individual buildings

#draw a map first? 

#dungeon?? #overworld??
  #start in a place like skyrim, maybe a prisoner
